##  <p align="center"> **WE CHOOSE ATAC-Seq Analysis**
 
 ### **What ATAC-Seq is**

ATAC-Seq, acronym of Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing, is a technique for assessing chromatin accessibility and how it affects gene expression. The chromatin consists of several nucleosome units. A nucleosome is a complex of DNA and histone proteins that keeps DNA compact through packaging. For transcription to occur, DNA must be loosened from the nucleosomes to make it accessible to transcription factors. This accessibility of DNA mediated by chromatin is a key component of epigenetics.

In this project, we are reproducing the ATAC-Seq analysis [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/epigenetics/tutorials/atac-seq/tutorial.html#trimming-reads) from the Galaxy Project. We've reproduced it completely with Linux Command Line tools too.

#### What Our Analysis is About?
 - The ATAC-Seq analysis is done compare the predicted open chromatin regions to the known binding sites of CTCF, a DNA-binding protein implicated in 3D structure: CTCF. CTCF is known to bind to thousands of sites in the genome and thus it can be used as a positive control for assessing if the ATAC-Seq experiment is good quality. Good ATAC-Seq data would have accessible regions both within and outside of TSS, for example, at some CTCF binding sites. For that reason, we will download

#### Datasets
 - Data is gotten from the study of Buenrostro et al. 2013. The data from the original dataset is downsized to 200,000 randomly selected reads and about 200,000 reads pairs that will map to chromosome 22. Binding sites of CTCF identified by ChIP in the same cell line from ENCODE (ENCSR000AKB, dataset ENCFF933NTR are also used.

<br>
 
****_Filtering of uninformative mapped reads_****

1. Install samtools
2.```samtools view -q 30 -f 0x2 -b -h Aligned\_output.sam \; Filtered\_output.bam```

This will filter out uninformative reads (Mapping quality \&gt;= 30 &amp; Properly Paired)

 </details> 
  
#### B) Filter duplicate reads
  
  <details>
<summary>Galaxy Implementation</summary>
<br>
   
***_Remove duplicates_***

Select the **MarkDuplicates**   **tool** with the following parameters

1. param-file &quot;Select SAM/BAM dataset or dataset collection&quot;: Select the output of Filter tool &quot;BAM&quot;
2. &quot;If true do not write duplicates to the output file instead of writing them with appropriate flags set&quot;: Yes

Click on the eye icon of the MarkDuplicate metrics.
  
  </details>
  
 <details >
<summary>Linux Implementation</summary>
<br>
  
 **_Mark Duplicate Reads_**

- Download picard.jar in your working folder from [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/download/2.26.0/picard.jar) <br>
- From that directory, run <br> ````java -jar picard.jar -h```` to check whether it works (you can skip this step) <br>
- For sorting the output file from last step use- <br>``` samtools sort -T temp -O bam -o filtered\_output\_sorted.bam Filtered\_output.bam```<br>
- Finally, run <br>```java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates I=filtered\_output\_sorted.bam O=marked\_dup.bam M=marked\_dup.metrics.txt``` <br>for marking duplicates
- If you can have a look into the metrics in the metrics.txt file
  
    </details>
  
  #### C) Check Insert Sizes 
  
  <details>
<summary>Galaxy Implementation</summary>
<br>
   
****_Plot the distribution of fragment sizes_****

Select **Paired-end histogram tool** with the following parameters

1. param-file &quot;BAM file&quot;: Select the output of MarkDuplicates tool &quot;BAM output&quot;
2. &quot;Lower bp limit (optional)&quot;: 0
3. &quot;Upper bp limit (optional)&quot;: 1000

Click on the galaxy-eye (eye) icon of the lower one of the 2 outputs (the png file).

</details>
 
  <details >
<summary>Linux Implementation</summary>
<br>

***_Check Insert Sizes_***
   
Check Insert Size tells us the size of the DNA fragment the read pairs came from. For this step we have to make a plot of the frequencies of the reads in the bam file to observe the peaks around where there are likely Tn5 transposase activities into nucleosome-free regions.<br>

```$ sudo apt install r-base```<br>

```$ java -jar picard.jar CollectInsertSizeMetrics I=marked\_dup.bam O=chart.txt H=insertSizePlot.pdf M=0.5```<br>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/Insert sizes.PNG"> 

Two peaks can be observed around the 200bp and 400bp from the plot

  </details>
                                                                                                                                                    
 ### STEP 4 :- PEAK CALLING
- Peak calling helps us to identify regions where reads have piled up (peaks) greater than the background read coverage. Using MACS2 we will extend the start sites of the reads by 200bp (100bp in each direction) to assess coverage. Before using MACS2, we need to convert the output BAM file from MarkDuplicate stage to BED format because when we set the extension size in MACS2, it will only consider one read of the pair while here, we would like to use the information from both.

 ***_Convert BAM to BED_***

Convert BAM file (output of MarkDuplicates) into BED format by **bedtools BAM to BED converter**.

### STEP 5 :-Visualisation of Coverage 

#### A) Prepare the Datasets
                                                                                                                                                      
  1. **Extract CTCF peaks on chr22 in intergenic regions**
 - As our training dataset is focused on chromosome 22 we will only use the CTCF peaks from chr22. We expect to have ATAC-seq coverage at TSS but only good ATAC-seq have coverage on intergenic CTCF. Indeed, the CTCF protein is able to position nucleosomes and creates a region depleted of nucleosome of around 120bp. This is smaller than the 200bp nucleosome-free region around TSS and also probably not present in all cells. Thus it is more difficult to get enrichment.

In order to get the list of intergenic CTCF peaks of chr22, select the peaks on chr22 and then exclude the one which overlap with genes.

- **Filter data on any column using simple expressions**   with the following parameters:
  - Filter : Select the first dataset: ENCFF933NTR.bed.gz
  - With following condition: c1==&#39;chr22&#39;
- **bedtools Intersect intervals find overlapping intervals in various ways** with the following parameters:
  - File A to intersect with B: Select the output of  **Filter**  data on any column using simple expressions tool
  - Combined or separate output files: One output file per &#39;input B&#39; file
    - File B to intersect with A: Select the dataset chr22 genes
  - What should be written to the output file?: Write the original entry in A for each overlap (-wa)
  - Required overlap: Default: 1bp
  - Report only those alignments that  **do not**  overlap with file(s) B: Yes
- Rename the datasets intergenic CTCF peaks chr22.
                                                                                                                                                     
</details>

#### B)Convert bedgraph from MACS2 to bigwig
- To visualise any region of the genome very quickly, we need to change the bedgraph format from MACS2 output to binary bigwig format.

 #### C) Create heatmap of coverage at TSS with deepTool
 
- For checking the coverage on specific regions, we can compute heatmap. ComputeMatrix &amp; plotHeatmap from deepTools are useful for this purpose. We will here make a heatmap centered on the transcription start sites (TSS) and another one centered on intergenic CTCF peaks.

- Using <strong>computeMatrix</strong> generate the matrix

1. Remove the first header line from chr22.bed file
2. Then run <br>
 ```computeMatrix reference-point --referencePoint TSS -R chr22.bed -S macs.bw --missingDataAsZero -o output\_from\_computeMatrix.gz``` <br>

- plotHeatmap will generate the plot using the output of computeMatrix <br>

````plotHeatmap -m output\_from\_computeMatrix.gz -out plotHeatMap.png````

- Repeating the previous two steps for plotting **CTCF peaks of chr22 in intergenic regions** with slight moderation: <br>

````computeMatrix reference-point --referencePoint center -R intergenic\_ctcf\_peaks\_chr22 -S macs.bw --missingDataAsZero -o peak\_output\_from\_computeMatrix.gz```` <br>

````plotHeatmap -m peak\_output\_from\_computeMatrix.gz -out intragenic\_plotHeatMap.png````

In the generated heatmaps, each line will be a transcript. The coverage will be summarized with a color code from red (no coverage) to blue (maximum coverage). All TSS will be aligned in the middle of the figure and only the 2 kb around the TSS will be displayed. Another plot, on top of the heatmap, will show the mean signal at the TSS. There will be one heatmap per bigwig.

For TSS, our data gives the following heatmap-

 <p align="center"> <img src="images/MACS2%20bigwig.PNG"> 

The plot on top shows a non-symmetric pattern that is higher on the left, which is expected as usually the promoter of active genes is accessible.

For CTCF peaks of chr22 in intergenic regions, the following heatmap is generated from our data-

<p align="center"> <img src="images/plotHeatmap%20output.PNG"> 
                                                        
This heatmap is showing a much more symmetric pattern.

- From the figure, we can see 3 accessible TSS for 6 transcripts for 2 genes. The TSS of RAC2 corresponds to an ATAC-Seq peak whereas there is no significant coverage on both TSS of SSTR3. Again, it can be said that only the first peak on the left overlaps with a CTCF binding site represents accessible loci. Amongst the 4 peaks in this plotted region, the 2 peaks in the middle do not correspond to CTCF peaks or TSS. As CTCF creates accessible regions, a region containing a peak with no corresponding CTCF peak or TSS could be a putative enhancer. In the pyGenomeTracks plot we see a region like this located in the intron of a gene and another one between genes. More analyses are needed to assess if it is a real enhancer, for example, histone ChIP-seq, 3D structure, transgenic assay, etc.

## Conclusion

ATAC-Seq is a method to investigate the chromatin accessibility and the genome is treated with a transposase (enzyme) called Tn5. It marks open chromatin regions by cutting and inserting adapters for sequencing. Low quality bases, adapter contamination, correct insert size and PCR duplicates (duplication level) were checked. Mapped the reads with  **Bowtie2** , filtered the reads for properly paired, good quality and reads that do not map to the mitochondrial genome. Open chromatin regions were found with  **MACS2** , a tool to find regions of genomic enrichment (peaks). The read coverage around TSS was investigated with the help of  **computeMatrix**  and  **plotHeatmap**. The peaks and other informative tracks, such as CTCF binding regions and hg38 genes were visualised with the help of  **pyGenomeTracks**. At the end, open chromatin regions that did not overlap with CTCF sites or TSS, which could be potential putative enhancer regions detected by the ATAC-Seq experiment.
